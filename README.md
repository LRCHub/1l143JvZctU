[00:00.21] Some days, I really wanna hate you
[00:04.85] 'Cause you always know just what to say
[00:10.08] By now, I know the words to break you
[00:14.63] And you know what breaks me, too
[00:30.63] 
[00:19.16] When things get heated
[00:21.35] We say things, we don't mean it
[00:24.19] Though we know they ain't true
[00:29.02] Say you're leaving
[00:31.46] Get careless with our feelings
[00:33.98] What's the worst we can do?
[00:47.48] 
[00:37.95] I didn't tell you all my secrets just to pull my heart out
[00:43.16] I didn't take you to my family just to show you their house
[00:47.80] I didn't work this hard to get this far then leave it so soon
[00:52.67] I didn't love to lose somebody like you
[00:56.53] (Love to lose somebody like you)
[01:12.53] 
[00:58.90] Some nights, we're closer than ever
[01:04.08] Sometimes, we're running out of space
[01:08.76] When we're high, it can't get any better
[01:13.72] Until we come down again
[01:25.72] 
[01:18.20] Things get heated
[01:20.65] We say things, we don't mean and
[01:22.91] Though we know they ain't true
[01:27.97] Say you're leaving
[01:30.41] Get careless with our feelings
[01:32.76] What's the worst we can do?
[01:46.26] 
[01:36.98] I didn't tell you all my secrets just to pull my heart out
[01:41.99] I didn't take you to my family just to show you their house
[01:46.87] I didn't work this hard to get this far then leave it so soon
[01:51.50] I didn't love to lose somebody like you
[01:55.43] Somebody like you
[02:03.93] 
[02:00.71] Somebody like you
[02:09.21] 
[02:07.11] Things get heated
[02:09.38] We say things, we don't mean it
[02:12.10] Though we know they ain't true
[02:27.10] 
[02:16.15] I didn't tell you all my secrets just to pull my heart out
[02:21.16] I didn't take you to my family just to show you their house
[02:25.96] I didn't work this hard to get this far then leave it so soon
[02:30.85] I didn't love to lose somebody like you
[02:50.35] 
[02:35.08] Somebody like you
[02:39.92] Somebody, somebody like you
[02:45.02] Somebody like you
[02:48.13] Somebody, somebody like you
[02:50.68] I didn't love to lose somebody like you
[02:54.53] Somebody like you
